Regular Expression is a kind of match pattern.
Basically, there are two kinds of match elements.
  ~~~
    * postion
    * characters
  ~~~
Since most of us are very familar with characters,
let talk about `postion matching` now.

### 1. What is a postion element
Simply, a postion elment is the postion in a string between `characters`
The `^` character below means where a position is.
~~~
^T^h^i^s^ ^h^a^s^ ^p^o^s^i^t^i^o^n^ ^e^l^e^m^e^n^t^s^.^
~~~

Actually, a position element equals a null character, in javascript is "".
```
"briefy" = "" + "b" + "" + "r" + "" + "i" + "" + "e" + "" + "f" + "" + "y" + ""
```

### 2. How to match it
In javascript, we use the following to match a postion.
>`^` `$` `\b` `\B` `(?=p)` `(?!p)`

#### 2.1
`^`, a caret means the first postion in a line, so as to say the red `^` below.

> <span style="color:red">^</span> This has position elements.

Let's replace it with a `?` 
~~~
'This has position elements.'.replace(/^/,'?')
//"?This has position elements."
~~~

`$`, a dollar means the last postion in a line.
>This has position elements.<span style="color: red">^</span>

Let's replace it with a `?` 
~~~
'This has position elements.'.replace(/$/,'?')
//"This has position elements.?"
~~~

**Heads-up!**  
When the multiple line flag `m` is enabled,
`\n` in a string will separate a `^` and `$`.  
Let's see the example below.
~~~~
'This is \n a multiline'.replace(/^|$/g,'?')
/*
"?This is 
 a multiline?"
*/
~~~
'This is \n a multiline'.replace(/^|$/mg,'?')
/*
"?This is ?
? a multiline?"
*/
~~~~

#### 2.2 **\b** and **\B**
`\b` is boundary between words, so as to say, `\w` and `\W`, `^` and `\w`, `$` and `\w`
>^This^ ^has^ ^word^ ^boundaries^.

Let's use javascript to find the `boundaries` below: 
~~~
'This has word boundaries.'.replace(/\b/g,'?')
// "?This? ?has? ?word? ?boundaries?."
~~~

`\B` is the opposite of `\b`,means not a boundary, so as to say
`\w`and`\w`, `\W`and`\W`, `^`and`\W`, `$`and`\W`  

Let's use javascript to find the `non-boundaries` below: 
~~~
'This has word boundaries.'.replace(/\B/g,'?')
// T?h?i?s h?a?s w?o?r?d b?o?u?n?d?a?r?i?e?s.?"
~~~

#### 2.3 **(?=postion)** and **(?!position)**
**(?=position)** is lookahead position  
**(?!position)** is negative-lookahead position  
<small>(?<=position) and (?<!position) are not supported</small>

Let's find the position which ahead of `java` is `script`.
~~~
"javascript is awesome.".replace(/(?=(s|S)cript)/,'?')
// "java?script is awesome."
~~~

### Here comes the end
Let's try to figure out what is the usage of the regexp below,
if you dont know,just email me:  
`(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-zA-Z_])^\w{6,12}$`
`(?!^[0-9]{6,12})(?!^[a-zA-Z_]{6,12})^\w{6,12}$`
